 Authenticate Accounts via OpenID Connect
##########################################

.. note::

    OpenID Connect Authentication is a Flower Enterprise feature. See `Flower Enterprise
    <https://flower.ai/enterprise>`_ for details.

In this guide, you'll learn how to configure SuperLink with account-level authentication
and authorization, and how to log in using the ``flwr`` CLI. Once logged in, any Flower
accounts that are authorized on the SuperLink can run Flower CLI commands that interact
with the SuperLink.

.. important::

    With account authentication and authorization enabled, only accounts that have
    submitted the ``flwr run`` command can view and interact with their runs. This means
    that your runs are **private by default**, ensuring that only authorized accounts
    can access them.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

To enable account authentication and authorization, the SuperLink must be deployed with
an `OpenID Connect (OIDC) <https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/>`_ provider
and an `OpenFGA <https://openfga.dev/>`_ server. The OIDC provider is used for account
authentication, while OpenFGA is used for fine-grained access control. This means an
authenticated account can only run ``flwr`` CLI commands on the SuperLink if they have
been granted the necessary permissions by the SuperLink administrator. When enabled,
both account authentication and authorization must be configured on the SuperLink.

Enable Account Authentication and Authorization on the SuperLink
================================================================

Create a YAML configuration file with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

    authentication:
      authn_type: oidc
      authn_url:          # OIDC provider's authorization_endpoint
      token_url:          # OIDC provider's token_endpoint
      validate_url:       # OIDC provider's account-authinfo_endpoint
      oidc_client_id:     # OIDC provider Client ID
      oidc_client_secret: # The corresponding Client Secret

    authorization:
      authz_type: openfga
      authz_url:          # The base OpenFGA API URL
      store_id:           # The store ID containing the model store
      model_id:           # The model ID containing the latest authorization model for the SuperLink
      relation:           # The authorized relation between the account and the resource, e.g. `has_access`
      object:             # The object and identifier at which an account has an authorized relation.
                          # The expected format is `object_type:object_identifier`, e.g.:
                          #   service:researchgrid
                          #   │       └─ Identifier of the object
                          #   └─ Object type

Save this file as ``account-auth-config.yaml``. Then pass it to the SuperLink via the
``--account-auth-config`` flag when deploying the SuperLink:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flower-superlink \
        --account-auth-config=account-auth-config.yaml
        <other flags>

.. note::

    To authorize an account, the SuperLink administrator must add the account's OIDC
    ``sub`` claim to the OpenFGA store with the appropriate relation.

.. warning::

    Starting with Flower ``v1.23.0``, the following options/keys have been renamed:

    - ``auth_type`` → ``authn_type`` (in YAML configuration)
    - ``auth_url`` → ``authn_url`` (in YAML configuration)
    - ``--user-auth-config`` → ``--account-auth-config`` (in SuperLink CLI)

************************
 Login to the SuperLink
************************

Once a SuperLink with account authentication and authorization is up and running, an
account can interface with it after installing the ``flwr`` PyPI package via the Flower
CLI. Configure the SuperLink connection in your Flower Configuration file (typically
located at ``$HOME/.flwr/config.toml``):

.. code-block:: toml
    :caption: config.toml

    [superlink]
    default = "my-prod-superlink"  # Set the default connection configuration

    [superlink.my-prod-superlink]
    address = "<SUPERLINK-ADDRESS>:<CONTROL-API-PORT>"   # Address of the SuperLink Control API
    root-certificate = "<PATH/TO/ca.crt>" # TLS certificate set for the SuperLink. Required for self-signed certificates.

.. note::

    - Account authentication and authorization is only supported with TLS connections.
    - Setting the default connection is optional. If you don't set your SuperLink as
      default, you can specify the connection name explicitly in each command, for
      example: ``flwr login my-prod-superlink``.

Learn more about the Flower Configuration file in the `Flower Configuration
<ref-flower-configuration.html>`_ reference.

You need to login first before other CLI commands can be executed. Upon executing ``flwr
login``, a URL will be returned by the authentication plugin in the SuperLink. Click on
it and authenticate directly against the OIDC provider.

.. code-block:: console

    $ flwr login
    A browser window has been opened for you to log into your Flower account.
    If it did not open automatically, use this URL:
    https://account.flower.blue/realms/flower/device?user_code=...
    # [... follows URL and logs in ... in the meantime the CLI will wait ...]
    ✅ Login successful.

Once the login is successful, the credentials returned by the OIDC provider via the
SuperLink will be stored locally. The tokens will be sent transparently with each
subsequent ``flwr`` CLI request to the SuperLink, and it will relay them to the OIDC
provider to perform the authentication checks.

**************************************
 Run authorized ``flwr`` CLI commands
**************************************

With the above steps completed, you can now run ``flwr`` CLI commands against a
SuperLink setup with account authentication and authorization. For example, as an
authorized account, you can run the ``flwr run`` command to start a Flower app:

.. code-block:: console

    $ flwr run
    🎊 Successfully built flwrlabs.myawesomeapp.1-0-0.014c8eb3.fab
    🎊 Successfully started run 1859953118041441032

If the account does not have the necessary permissions to run the command, an error will
be returned:

.. code-block:: console

    $ flwr run
    ╭─ Error ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Authentication failed. Please run `flwr login` to authenticate and try again.    │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
